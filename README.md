# quickloot-sse
[WIP] Port of Quick Loot by himika to Skyrim: Special Edition

This is only for the skse plugin portion of the mod, if all goes well the flash portion will not have to change.

## How to compile the dll (current skse version: 2.0.4)
 - Download and install skse64 source.
 - Go to skse64.sln directory.
 - Clone this repository into directory
 - Add QuickLoot_SSE.vcxproj to skse64.sln
 - Should now be able to compile the dll
